## ðŸ›’ Hakim Livs Webshop â€” Fullstack Project

This is a fullstack e-commerce application built for the client *Hakim* by a cross-functional student team using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) following **Scrum methodology**.

  - RESTful API with endpoints for products, categories, users, and orders
  - Admin-restricted product management
  - Public and protected order flows
- **Challenges**: Schema validation, secure auth token handling, syncing test data during development
- **API Documentation**: Available live at `/api/` and in Postman JSON format
